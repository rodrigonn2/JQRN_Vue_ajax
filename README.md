## About
This project integrates a Vue.js frontend with a Lumen-based API to showcase major football clubs from the Paulista Championship. Using Vue components and JavaScript's Fetch API, dynamic data from the backend is rendered to the website.

The site features four football clubs, each with its own set of details and player information. Users can interact with each team to explore unique stats and content for that club.

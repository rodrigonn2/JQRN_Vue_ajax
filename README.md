## About

This project is designed to practice full-stack development using Vue.js on the front-end and a Lumen-based API on the back-end. The application emphasizes the use of computed properties in Vue.js—highlighting their structure, their differences from methods, and how they automatically track reactive dependencies. It also delves into the lifecycle of a Vue instance, with a focus on the creation, mounting, updating, and destruction phases.
To illustrate these concepts, the project features a website dedicated to football in São Paulo, showcasing the region's major teams, their stadiums, and key players. All content is rendered dynamically, providing a smooth and interactive user experience without requiring page reloads.
